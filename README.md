# Hi, friends! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michel, and I'm an Italian-Brazilian PhD in Economics and a self-taught developer.
I'm new to GitHub, but I've been working on the development of **computational models for economic and financial analysis** for almost 20 years. Soon, I'll be sharing some of my work here.

I was born in Brazil but now live in Italy, near Rome. For 15 years, I worked as an **Economics professor**, teaching corporate finance, economic modeling, and entrepreneurship. Currently, I work as a **consultant** and develop personal projects that I hope will bring valuable insights (and maybe some returns!) in the future.

My coding experience includes **C++, NetLogo, CUDA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python**, but in the last year, I've been focusing more on **web technologies** and frameworks compatible with modern development practices.

If you think I can help with something or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!


**See you around! ðŸš€**
